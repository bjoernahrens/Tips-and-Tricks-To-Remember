<blockquote>
<p><code>Time</code> is a Swift package that makes dealing with calendar values a natural and straight-forward process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Working with calendars can be extremely complicated and error-prone. <code>Time</code> solves these problems by clarifying concepts and restricting improper usage through type-safe APIs.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
<p>Here's the TL;DR of the documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to know what time it is, you need a <code>Clock</code>. You can get the device's clock by using <code>Clock.system</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code>Clock</code> can tell you the current time via some functions. For example, <code>.today()</code> will give you the current calendar day. <code>.thisMinute()</code> will give you the current time, accurate down to the <em>minute</em> level.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of these returned values has methods to retrieve more- and less- precise values. For example, <code>today.hours()</code> will give you a sequence of all the "Hour" values in the day.</p></li>
<li><p>These values also are how you <em>format</em> them into human-readable strings (via the <code>.format(...)</code> method)</p></li>
</ul>
