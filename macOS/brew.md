## What does Homebrew do?
* Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didn’t.
	```shell
	brew install 
	```
* Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into `/usr/local`.
* Homebrew won’t install files outside its prefix and you can place a Homebrew installation wherever you like.
* It's all Git and Ruby underneath, so hack away with the knowledge that you can easily revert your modifications and merge upstream updates.
* Homebrew complements macOS. Install your RubyGems with `gem` and their dependencies with `brew`.
* "To install, drag this icon..." – no more. `brew cask` installs macOS apps, fonts and plugins and other non-open source software.
